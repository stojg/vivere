# Vivere

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stojg/vivere.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stojg/vivere)

So.. every project should have a README that tells you what the reason of project, how to
install and in these awesome days of open source; how to contribute and most of all the sales pitch.

## Why does this project even exist?

I've always wanted to be a game developer, because pew-pew and amazing stories. Game developers are
always in my mind imagined as rock stars. Fame fortune and quick and dirty hacks. I know this is
just a delusion on my part, but I prefer to stick to it.

Games are awesome because

1.  They engage the abstract parts of our brain
2.  They are technically challenging to make
3.  One of the reasons why have super computers disguised as phones

I also like the challenge and failing is okay.

## How do you install this thing?

Umm, yeah.. Do you have go installed? Otherwise tough luck. I believe you can install with
`go get github.com/stojg/vivere` but I'm to much of a n00b to know if that actually works.

 If you actuallt got the `library` into your $GOHOME folder, you need to run the server by running the `vivere` bin
 inside the library folder, since I'm serving the static files from the project root.

## How to you contribute

If you really want to contribute, do a Pull Request and tell me how much
I suck and that why I should do it your way. I most likely will reject the PR since this
is a project where I'm learning to `go` and how to organize a game engine.

## Sales pitch

Heh, you're kidding me? I'm a developer, I'm doing this as a hobby and trying to learn something.
There are a ton of free (as in beer) AAA game engines out there that actually let you focus on making a game instead
of a game engine.

What I can give you is a mostly broken link to the heroku build of the lib - [enigmatic inlet 8706](enigmatic-inlet-8706.herokuapp.com)

On a side note: Go is awesome and weird, read up about `channels`, `slices` and `interfaces`. They will
make you think that you had too much unicorn beer.
